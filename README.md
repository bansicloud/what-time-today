The works: react, redux, google calendar api, react-big-calendar, momentjs

Todo based on feedback?:
- [x] AM/PM Toggle
- [x] 24hr Toggle
- [x] Merging availabilities
- [ ] Switch to whichti.me domain
- [ ] Google verification
- [ ] Add different availability types: Free, OOO, Busy, Busy (but could reschedule for right reason)
- [ ] Have 24hr toggle also change the times on the calendar
- [ ] Encode events into uri so you can send a URL and others can view your availability on the calendar
- [ ] How to button/instructions
- [ ] Home screen/landing page?
- [ ] Clean up crappy codebase
- [ ] Title/header that makes more sense
- [ ] More timezones
